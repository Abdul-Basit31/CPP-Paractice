C++ Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

(i) int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
(ii)double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
(iii)char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
(iv)string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
(v)bool - stores values with two states: true or false
