                                                   //Constants
//When you do not want others (or yourself) to change existing variable values, use the const keyword 
//(this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

//Example1:
const int myNum = 15;  // myNum will always be 15
myNum = 10;  // error: assignment of read-only variable 'myNum'

//Example2:
const int minutesPerHour = 60;
const float PI = 3.14;
